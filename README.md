File Information
--------------------------------------------------------

- Images (graphics/samples/)**
  - 14,248 cropped face images. Balanced in terms of ethnicity. Mirror images included to enhance pose variation.
- Labels (labels/c&z.csv and labels/c&z.p)
  - CSV file with attribute information: Filename, Age, Ethnicity, Eyes Color, Facial Hair, Gender, Glasses, Hair Color, Hair Covered, Hair Style, Smile and Visible Forehead.
We also include Pickle format to load in Python.
- Code (scripts_tensorflow/classification.py and generate_subfolders.py)
  - Script to do classification benchmarks using Tensorflow.
  - Script to generate adequate subfolder of specific attribute. Useful to load into frameworks of machine learning.
- HDCGAN Synthetic Images (graphics/hdcgan/)
  - 4,239 face images generated by HDCGAN trained on CelebA. Resized at 128x128.
- Additional Images (graphics/extra/samples/, labels/extra_c&z.csv and labels/extra_c&z.p)**
  - 3,384 cropped face images with labels. Ethnicity: White.
